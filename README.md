MOTIVATION
==========

I created this app, because I needed a copying tool that could rename files, 
in a Dropbox compatible manner, whilst they were being copied.

BACKGROUND
==========

Dropbox does not accept certain file names in its folder, 
e.g. folders or files with a file name that starts with a space.
When Dropbox finds such a file, it automatically removes 
all the incompatible characters from the file name.

The problem I encountered arises, when the file copy process takes longer to finish, 
than Dropbox takes to detect and rename the new file(s). 

USAGE
=====

1. Download ZIP-File to Desktop
2. Open XCode-Project
3. Click "Product-Clean"
4. Click "Product-Run"
